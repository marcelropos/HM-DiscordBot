# Alumni Support

Contrary to previous drafts, there will not be a 7+ role, see below how it is solved instead.

## General changes

So that confusion is low, the study group chats (not the role) will be renamed to the start of studies. So for example `IF5` will be renamed to `IF-WS21/22`.

## Alumni Command

When students are in the 6. semester or higher (students may finish one semester early) they are allowed to use the alumni command.

If the command is made around the change of the semester (+1 month after semester start), the bot will ask the student what semester he graduated.

When using the command here is what happens:

* The student looses his study group role (example: IF7)
* The student looses all his subject roles
* He gets the role named `alumni`
* He gets a new (if it doesn't exists yet) role named `alumni-<study-group>-<year>` where year is in following format: `WS00/00 | SS00`. An example: `alumni-IF-SS23`
* He get a direct access permission to the study group chat
